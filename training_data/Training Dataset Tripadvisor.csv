65;The room was not clean there was a lot of sand on the floor of the bathroom, no tissues in the room, no sponge, no enough shampoo and they do not refill it if it was empty the room is always not clean enough and they pretend they are a 5 stars hotel;0
66;Rooms were ok but the lower end rooms look nothing like those in the photos.;0
67;The worst place to stay. If you are staying in the end rooms apparently the room does not get cold at all.. In fact the room is suffocating. After asking the front desk to check it 4 times in one day.. They kept saying its centrally air conditioned.;0
68;Our experience was terrible. The room was not clean, bed sheets had holes in it and the door handle was falling off. Also, the first room we have had was super small. ;0

77;Room was disgusting dirty ripped sheets located above a shop or bar on the far side of the so called resort which was more like a concentration camp.;0
78;Room was terrible. it felt like we been in prison;0
79;Booked a Family room with 3 twin beds. Got here the room does not look like the one from the pictures and has a queen bed and one twin bed. Toilet flush doesn't work. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SAFE!!!! There is no manager who could help us.. and there I'd no room available to change. The wifi does not work in the room. All and all the worst experience ever…;0
80;I payed for delux room and only got a standard room. It was very small and dirty room.;0

88;We tried many different local restaurants and was never unhappy with quality of food in any of them.;1
89;The breakfast is included and has a choice of fruit, various breads, lovely home made honey, fresh omelettes and a range of continental options. Was perfect for us and we loved trying the new food on offer. ;1

103;Breakfast is good. We enjoyed our stay and dinner watching the beautiful Sunset;1

105;Food was good at dinner and breakfast ;1
106;Although the hotel restaurant was only average for dinner, breakfast was very good.;1
107;The dinner and breakfast were a treat! A very large choice of foods that tasted almost too good. ;1

110;Food was great specially the breakfast! Everything was fresh and tasty.. ;1
111;Food is not good at all, roka salad was not fresh, inside of the salmon was not cooked and came back with no apology whatsoever.;1
112;Very limited menu and if you order one single thing outside the menu you will be charged. I must admit, we could not find something very nice to eat. Service personnel and especially restaurant chef were far from being professional, not smiling at all What you pay for a coke is the ten times more than its cost in Turkey.;1
113;Food is just okay not great.;1
114;The food was bearable. Dry processed rolls and a lack of fresh produce which seems strange for Turkey which has such good fruits, herbs and vegetables. Their evening menu could benefit from concentrating on doing Turkish food well rather than western food badly. ;1
115;The food was generally cold, especially the french fries. The last evening even the pasta was cold. Obviously the had taken it out of the fridge and forgotten to heat it. ;1
116;food choice boring ate out after a couple of nights;1
117;the food horrible and the building in general disrepair.;1
118;Due to covid the food was behind screens and very limited in choice, breakfasts consisted of sloppy scrambled eggs rock hard scones salads and omelettes cooked to order if you want to queue for 20 minutes. I don’t eat bread as a rule but found myself craving toast . Lunch and evening meals - limited choice salty and samey. ;1
119;Food is like from cheap buffet, every day same. No fresh juice, alcohol is like water.;1
120;Not great, the food was terrible;1
121;The foods are salty. For water or any simple drink you have to wait 15-20 minutes. ;1
122;Eveything is dirty in the food court.;1
123;The food is barely edible and recycled very badly ;1
124;Most of the drinks are extra. Free drinks are awful.;1
125;First of all the food was tasteless.;1
126;Whilst there is a lot of food, the quality is very low.;1
127;The tables are dirty, there was food on the floor, there were plates not cleared away, at one point, I had all three courses of plates sat in front of me at the table. ;1
128;The food was dreadful. A real disappointment all round.;1
129;Buffet food isn't good nearly the same each day, hot food was luke warm.;1
130;The food quality was the worst.;1
131;Even the food was awful, some of the worst I have tasted. ;1
132;The food variety, quality is really really bad. Especially the breakfast is the worst I've ever seen in such a all included concept. We had found hair in the food for three times.;1
133;The food was eatable on some occasions, but was in most dishes very bland and very repetitive dishes that was boring me after 3 days.;1
134;Food - repetitive, bland, stale and recycled daily, turkey passed off as lamb kebab, boiled frankfurters, rubbery cheese - no cheddar, flavourless salads, horribly sweet cakes, soaked in honey and olive oil, waterlogged steamed rice, stale chips fried and retried daily at all mealtimes, eggs: boiled, fried, scrambled, omelette. Nothing catered for children and babies;1
135;Food was all cold and canteen standard. Drinks were ok.;1
136;The quality of food and drinks is very poor the juices are sweetened colored water. It was terrible.;1
137;The food is disgusting the drinks are vile and the bar staff are a joke.;1
138;The food is terrible!!! Worst Turkish food i have ever had. ;1
139;The food was bland and not very good. The same old dishes being brought out day after day until they were eaten.;1
140;They serve the same bland meals every day and do not eat any of the food before you check that it has been cooked. As 2/3 times it will be RAW!;1
141;The staff on check in were excellent, professional and friendly. ;2

164;The hotel has a great quality and the staff is making super job ! ;2
165;Have never experienced a hotel where every single member of staff acknowledged you and treats you like royalty. Staff constantly cleaning and checking on everything.;2
166;This definitely added to the excellent service of staff in every part of the hotel. Every staff member with whom we came in contact with was attentive, kind and professional including receptionists, room service staff, ;2
167;All i can say is the staff are amazing.;2
168;The staff were the best I have ever experienced anywhere in the world for customer service, attention to detail and friendliness. The hotel management team were a dream team and constantly monitoring for the guests safety;2
169;The staff are a real credit to the hotel, all ways smiling and friendly and very attentive. It doesn’t matter where you are, they remember you and and are ready and waiting with your favourite drinks. ;2
170;I must say this hotel exceeds all our expectations, the staff are absolutely amazing;2
171;There was not enough staff to serve the food which was carried out behind screens so you had to queue waiting to be served whilst your food was going cold. I wouldn't mind it was that hot to begin with.We observed staff standing around aimlessly talking and on their phones. ;2
172;When arriving reception staff had very limited English and in my opinion was rude.;2
173;Feeding this back to reception thought out the week were rude, dismissive and inattentive. The canteen staff were a mixture of decent and and awful. ;2
174;Staff at this hotel are arrogant, rude and will not smile to save there own lives no matter how many times you say please or thank you!;2
175;Very rude front office staff , we stayed there for 10 days and during this days the front office was not helpful at all and they don't speak english.;2

181;Staff are rude and customer service is below average;2
182;Reception staff were very rude and seemed like they didn’t want to be there, checking in and out was very uncomfortable to say the least ;2

198;Staff were useless and rude at reception.;2
199;The staff here are really ignorant all they want is to sell massages and when you refuse they're rude to you.Even when they do have clients they can be found behind the bar asleep while poor man waits 10 mins looking for staff!!!;2
200;Hotel staff, especially reception, speak absolutely no English! This is shocking as I have stayed in many other hotels in Bodrum and have had no issues with communicating with hotel staff. Reception had no idea what I was saying even for very basic things. ;2
201;The pool area is lovely, with a bar close by and the beach/decking area is also very nice.;3
202;Beach and pool are amazing.;3
203;We had no issues getting sun beds by the pool or beach ;3
204;The pool and the beach were equally great and the service provided at both was fantastic. ;3
205;The pool and beach area were great, and a small, but sufficient ;3
206;The pool isn't huge but fits perfectly within its location. A raised sandy beach. More than enough sun beds....and the sun beds by the pool are probably the best I have ever used.;3
207;I loved the pool area with luxe, padded sun beds and towels supplied.;3
208;We spent most days by the pool as the sunbeds are really comfy, its got its own pool bar and the pool area in general felt more exclusive and relaxed than the beach. We loved playing pool and table tennis!! The pool was great but the sea was lovely too.;3

222;Beaches and pool are cramped. horrible stay.;3
223;We all had turkish tummy from the hotel and some had terrible rashes from the lack of pool hygiene.;3
224;The hotel's outside pool was slimy green and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in over a year. ;3
225;The jacuzzi was freezing and the indoor pool was not heated.;3
226;The hotel is such a scam. The pool is small and nothing like the picture. ;3
227;"The indoor ""heated"" pool and Jacuzzi is colder than the outside pool and they charge you 10 Euros to use it daily.";3
228;I got and others got a serious ear infection from the Pool, and a bill for nearly £200 with the hospital and the Medication and about 6 weeks to get back to normal.;3
229;The indoor swimming pool was also closed all week. It was a shame.;3
230;The private beach and pool gets very crowded.;3
231;There were no service personel at either the beach or the pool.;3
232;Beach club and pool area were overcrowded on our visit - some days we struggled to get lounger and when we visited beach club once there were no spare beach umbrellas- all were taken - however this did noticieably improve once the eid celebrations were finished;3
233;There is nothing for children except big main pool and you feel disturbed by the fact that other guests are not comfortable with that!;3
234;The pool was too small.;3
235;The pool is crowded and very small. It was a shame.;3
236;The Pool was freezing ;3

243;The hotel is very good for this price. We would like to come again if we get the chance.;4
244;The hotel is very cheap, the service quality is unexpectedly good for the price.;4
245;A real price performance hotel. It's incredible to stay in such a beautiful hotel for such an affordable price.;4

254;It's a great deal for the price! In the future, we would want to return if we get the opportunity.;4
255;Prices in the A La Carte restaurant are very cheap compared to the quality of the foods.;4
256;If we look at the services in the hotel, I can say that we stayed very cheaply, we are very pleased.;4
257;We chose this hotel because the price was affordable, but we were very surprised when we saw the service quality. We really understood that the price was cheap.;4
258;In terms of hotel services, we had a great time at a great price.;4
259;Price-wise, the hotel's cuisine is a great quality.;4
260;The stores at the hotel are reasonably priced.;4

262;This money is too much for this hotel.;4
263;We paid 200 pounds per night, this hotel is not worth that much.;4
264;Drinks at the hotel are expensive. For this money we expected better service, frankly disappointing;4
265;They asked for an additional fee for everything during the stay at the hotel, which is really a nuisance. Too bad;4
266;The food in the hotel is of poor quality and expensive. With that much money, we could eat at a very good upscale restaurant. Surprisingly bad.;4
267;They asked for money even though we didn't use the minibar. We were disappointed and argued with the receptionist. I want my money back.;4
268;The minibar in the hotel room is very expensive. 0.33 cl of water should not be 4 pounds.;4
269;The free drinks at the poolside bar are very bad, they asked us for money for good drinks. Money trap;4
270;During our stay at the hotel, we were charged an extra cost for everything.;4
271;We paid too much money even though we didn't get any extra service. The hotel is very stingy.;4
272;The most expensive food and drinks in the world are in this hotel !!! Such high prices surprised us.;4
273;It's a disaster to stay in such a small room for this money. We paid too much money for this room, we didn't get what we paid for.;4
274;Playstation cafe in the hotel is very expensive. They wanted a lot of money for 1 hour of play. We had to pay that money for our child.;4
275;We were concerned by the extra fees. We have no plans to return. There's no point in paying for this accommodation. A very expensive hotel;4
276;Disgrace !!! Everything in the hotel is very expensive. It shouldn't be that high;4
277;They wanted money for everything. They would ask for money even for the breath we take. If we knew it was so expensive, we definitely wouldn't have come to this hotel. We regret it.;4
278;Foods are too expensive and of poor quality.;4
279;Extra charges bothered us. We do not intend to come again. This hotel is a complete waste of money.;4
280;Minibar is very expensive.;4
